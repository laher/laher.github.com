      <description>I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to address my high cholesterol and I think you can too.
 What the hell is a part-time vegan anyway? In my case, on Monday-to-Friday I don&amp;rsquo;t eat meat, eggs or dairy. On the weekend I eat what I like. Why? In a word, cholesterol. Why not full-time? I&amp;rsquo;m so not ready.  Changing diet is an emotional thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried a bunch of ways to improve my diet, and I&amp;rsquo;m doing better than when I was in my twenties - way less drinking, no smoking for 15 years, and many more healthy meals.</description>
