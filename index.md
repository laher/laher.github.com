Am's code
=========

Here are a few projects I've built in my spare time.

Go
--

 * [goxc](https://github.com/laher/goxc/) is a build tool for Go, with a focus on cross-compiling & packaging Go programs.
 * [someutils](https://github.com/laher/someutils/) is a partial re-implementation of coreutils in Go. Cross-platform. Includes versions of wget, scp, grep, g/un/zip, ls, mv, cp, tee, head, tail, which ... more coming all the time
 * [argo](https://github.com/laher/argo/) implements the .ar archive format in pure Go. argo mimics Go's APIs for other formats such as 'archive/tar'
 * [Gophertron](https://github.com/laher/gophertron/) is a small project I used for a talk on Go coverage testing. It uses go-restful and httptest.
 * [mkdo](https://github.com/laher/mkdo) is a command-line utility to make appropriate directories before running a given command.
 * [nettis](https://github.com/laher/nettis/) is an integration testing utility for network apps.
 * [debber](https://github.com/debber) is a tool for building Debian packages. It is already integrated into goxc (above), but its standalone tooling is under review.

Javascript
----------

 * [ChordialJS](http://www.laher.net.nz/ChordialJS/) is a pre-alpha javascript library for building guitar chords and progressions.

Python
------

These projects are from 4 years ago, but they still seem to work OK (Python 2.6 or 2.7)

 * [Didiball](https://code.google.com/p/didiball/) - a 2-player football game using PyGame
 * [Roll-o](https://code.google.com/p/roll-o/) - some experimentation with robot control. At the time I was using a BeagleBoard, a Pololu motor controller, and a Wii controller.
