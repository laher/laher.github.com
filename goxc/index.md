goxc
====

[goxc](https://github.com/laher/goxc) is a build tool for Go, with a focus on cross-compiling and packaging.

By default, goxc [g]zips (& .debs for Linux) the programs, and generates a 'downloads page' in markdown (with a Jekyll header). Goxc also provides integration with [bintray.com](https://bintray.com) for simple uploads.

goxc is written in Go but uses *os.exec* to call 'go build' with the appropriate flags & env variables for each supported platform.

goxc was inspired by Dave Cheney's Bash script [golang-crosscompile](https://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile).
BUT, goxc crosscompiles to all platforms at once. The artifacts are saved into a directory structure along with a markdown file of relative links.

Thanks to [dchest](https://github.com/dchest) for the tidy-up and adding the zip feature, and [matrixik](https://bitbucket.org/matrixik) for his improvements and input.

**NOTE: Version 0.5.0 and 0.6.0 have significant changes, which may affect you in certain cases - especially if you are using config files.**
**Please read about these changes [0.5](https://github.com/laher/goxc/wiki/upgrading-0.5) and [0.6](https://github.com/laher/goxc/issues/7)**

Notable Features
----------------
 * (re-)building toolchain to all or selected platforms.
 * Cross-compilation, to all supported platforms.
 * filtering on target platform (via commandline options or config file)
 * Zip (or tar.gz) archiving of cross-compiled artifacts
 * Packaging into .debs (for Debian/Ubuntu Linux)
 * Bundling of READMEs etc into archives
 * bintray.com integration (deploys binaries to bintray.com. bintray.com registration required.)
 * 'downloads page' generation (markdown format).
 * Configuration files for repeatable builds. Includes support for multiple configurations per-project.
 * Per-task configuration options.
 * Override files for 'local' working-copy-specific (or branch-specific) configurations.
 * Config file generation & upgrade (using -wc option).
 * go-test, go-vet, go-fmt, go-install, go-clean tasks.
 * version number interpolation during build/test/... (uses go's -ldflags compiler option)

Installation
--------------
goxc requires the go source and the go toolchain.

 1. [Install go from source](http://golang.org/doc/install/source). (Requires gcc (or MinGW) and 'hg')

 2. Install goxc:

            go get github.com/laher/goxc

Basic Usage
-----------

### Run once

To build the toolchains for all platforms:

       goxc -t

### Now build your artifacts

To build [g]zipped binaries and .debs for your app:

	cd path/to/app/dir
	goxc


More options
------------

Use `goxc -h options` to list all options.

 * e.g. To restrict by OS and Architecture:

	goxc -os=linux -arch="amd64 arm"

 * e.g. To set a destination root directory and artifact version number:

	goxc -d=my/jekyll/site/downloads -pv=0.1.1

 * 'Package version' can be compiled into your app if you define a VERSION variable in your main package.

"Tasks"
-------

goxc performs a number of operations, defined as tasks. You can specify tasks with the '-tasks=' option.

 * `goxc -t` performs one task called 'toolchain'. It's the equivalent of `goxc -tasks=toolchain ~`
 * The *default* task is actually several tasks, which can be summarised as follows:
    * validate (tests the code) -> compile (cross-compiles code) -> package ([g]zips up the executables and builds a 'downloads' page)
 * You can specify one or more tasks, such as `goxc -tasks=go-fmt,xc`
 * You can skip tasks with '-tasks-='. Skip the 'package' stage with `goxc -tasks-=package`
 * For a list of tasks and 'task aliases', run `goxc -h tasks`
 * For more info on a particular taks, run `goxc -h <taskname>`. This will also show you the configuration options available for that task.

Outcome
-------

By default, artifacts are generated and then immediately archived into (outputdir).

e.g.1 /my/outputdir/0.1.1/linux_arm/myapp_0.1.1_linux_arm.tar.gz
e.g.2 /my/outputdir/0.1.1/windows_386/myapp_0.1.1_windows_386.zip
e.g.3 /my/outputdir/0.1.1/linux_386/myapp_0.1.1_linux_386.deb

The version number is specified with -pv=0.1.1 .

By default, the output directory is ($GOBIN)/(appname)-xc, and the version is 'unknown', but you can specify these.

e.g.

      goxc -pv=0.1.1 -d=/home/me/myuser-github-pages/myapp/downloads/

*NOTE: it's **bad idea** to use project-level github-pages - your repo will become huge. User-level gh-pages are an option, but it's better to use the 'bintray' tasks.*:

If non-archived, artifacts generated into a directory structure as follows:

 (outputdir)/(version)/(OS)_(ARCH)/(appname)(.exe?)

Configuration file
-----------------

For repeatable builds (and some extra options), it is recomended to use goxc can use a configuration file to save and re-run compilations.

To create a config file, just use the -wc (write config) option.

	goxc -d=../site/downloads -os="linux windows" -wc

The configuration file is documented in much more detail in [the wiki](https://github.com/laher/goxc/wiki/config)

Limitations
-----------

 * Tested on Linux, Windows (and Mac during an early version). Please test on Mac and *BSD
 * Currently goxc is only designed to build standalone Go apps without linked libraries. You can try but YMMV
 * The *API* is not considered stable yet, so please don't start embedding goxc method calls in your code yet - unless you 'Contact us' first! Then I can freeze some API details as required.
 * Bug: issue with config overriding. Empty strings do not currently override non-empty strings. e.g. -pi="" doesnt override the json setting PackageInfo
