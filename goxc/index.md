goxc
====

[goxc](http://www.laher.net.nz/goxc) cross-compiles Go programs to (up to) 11 target platforms at once.

goxc is written in Go but uses *os.exec* to call 'go build' with the appropriate flags & env variables for each supported platform.

goxc was inspired by Dave Cheney's Bash script [golang-crosscompile](https://github.com/davecheney/golang-crosscompile).
BUT, goxc crosscompiles to all platforms at once. The artifacts are saved into a folder structure along with a markdown file of relative links.

Thanks to [dchest](https://github.com/dchest) for the tidy-up and adding the zip feature, and [matrixik](https://bitbucket.org/matrixik) for his improvements and input.

**NOTE: Version 0.5.0 (2013-03-24) is a major change. Please follow wiki links, [e.g. upgrading to 0.5](https://github.com/laher/goxc/wiki/upgrading-0.5) for more information!**

Installation
--------------
goxc requires the go source and the go toolchain.

 1. [Install go from source](http://golang.org/doc/install/source). (Requires gcc (or MinGW) and 'hg')

 2. Install goxc:

            go get github.com/laher/goxc

Basic Usage
-----------

### Run once

To build the toolchains for all 11 platforms:

       goxc -t

### Now build your artifacts

To build zipped binaries for your app:

	goxc path/to/app/folder

OR

	cd path/to/app/folder
	goxc


More options
------------

Use `goxc -h options` to list all options.

 * e.g. To restrict by OS and Architecture:

	goxc -os=linux -arch="amd64 arm"

 * e.g. To set a destination root folder and artifact version number:

	goxc -d=my/jekyll/site/downloads -pv=0.1.1

 * 'Package version' can be compiled into your app if you define a VERSION variable in your main package.

"Tasks"
-------

goxc performs a number of operations, defined as tasks. You can specify tasks with the '-tasks' option.

 * `goxc -t` performs one task called 'toolchain'. It's the equivalent of `goxc -tasks=toolchain ~`
 * By default, `goxc` performs several tasks, which can be summarised as follows:
    * validate -> (cross-)compile -> package
 * For a list of tasks, run `goxc -h tasks`

Outcome
-------

By default, artifacts are generated and then immediately zipped into (outputfolder).

e.g. /my/outputfolder/0.1.1/linux_arm/myapp_0.1.1_linux_arm.zip

If you specified the version number -pv=123 then the filename would be myapp_0.1.1_linux_arm_123.zip.

By default, the output folder is ($GOBIN)/(appname)-xc, and the version is 'unknown', but you can specify these.

e.g.

      goxc -pv=0.1.1 -d=/home/me/myapp/ghpages/downloads/


If non-zipped, artifacts generated into a folder structure as follows:

 (outputfolder)/(version)/(OS)_(ARCH)/(appname)(.exe?)

Configuration file
-----------------

For repeatable builds (and some extra options), it is recomended to use goxc can use a configuration file to save and re-run compilations.

To create a config file, just use the -wc (write config) option.

	goxc -d=../site/downloads -os="linux windows" -wc

The configuration file is documented in much more detail in [the wiki](https://github.com/laher/goxc/wiki/config)

Limitations
-----------

 * Tested on Linux, Windows (and Mac during an early version). Please test on Mac and *BSD
 * Currently goxc is only designed to build standalone Go apps without linked libraries. You can try but YMMV
 * Bug: issue with config overriding. Empty strings do not currently override non-empty strings. e.g. -pi="" doesnt override the json setting PackageInfo
 * The *API* is not considered stable yet, so please don't start embedding goxc method calls in your code yet - unless you 'Contact us' first! Then I can freeze some API details as required.
