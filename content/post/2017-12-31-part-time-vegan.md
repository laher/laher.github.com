I think I've found a way to address my high cholesterol and I think you can too.

-   _What the hell is a part-time vegan anyway?_ In my case, on Monday-to-Friday I don't eat meat, eggs or dairy. On the weekend I eat what I like.
-   _Why?_ In a word, cholesterol.
-   _Why not full-time?_ I'm so not ready.

Changing diet is an emotional thing. I've tried a bunch of ways to improve my diet, and I'm doing better than when I was in my twenties - way less drinking, no smoking for 15 years, and many more healthy meals. Sadly it's only got me so far.

As a meat-loving, milk-guzzling, buttery-cheese freak, I have emotional attachments to many 'wrong' foods.


# The cholesterol problem

Cholesterol is a type of fat circulating in your blood. If you have too much you can get into real trouble. I don't know if it's technically hereditary, but it's been a problem in my [father's] family for generations.

I have a cholesterol level of 6.4. Ideally you should be about 4.0, and NZ Health recommend 5.0 or under. *Note that there's more than one type of cholesterol - I have enough of the good stuff, but too much of the bad stuff*


## How to reduce cholesterol.

This is just a summary of what I've been advised by doctors, and what I've read. Please let me know if you have some insights on this.

-   Drink less, stop smoking.
-   Get plenty of light exercise. One hour of walking each day beats a weekly gym visit.
-   Reduce high-cholesterol foods
-   Maybe medicate ('statins'), but there can be some adverse side-effects.


## It's a fair cop

Going back some years, I was doing the wrong things. Lots of takeaways, drinking lots, not exercising enough.


# Initial attempts

-   I cut the drinking way back as a matter of course. It didn't help.
-   Lots of exercise for 9 months - no change.
-   I tried reducing my high-cholesterol foods here and there. I couldn't make a significant dent in it, and kept regressing.
-   I have considered statins, but I've been warned off them by the experiences of family members. Cramps, etc.


# The reality check

2 years later, I realised I had to take more drastic action. Really cut back on some high-cholesterol foods &#x2026; looking at a list of 'bad' foods, it hit me square in the jowls:

-   High-cholesterol foods are mostly meat (inc fish), dairy, eggs.
-   The only vegan-friendly examples I keep seeing are margarine and coconut milk.

# Enter stage left, part-time veganism

It just struck me that almost all of the high cholesterol food that I eat are due to meat, dairy and eggs. If I could just cut back heavily on those foods somehow, I should be able to fight off the cholesterol pretty quick IMO. Also, some veganism might make me feel good about my place in the world. Sheeps and piggies never called me 'hippy', yet here I am eating animals instead of humans.

Recognising that I could concoct basic foods for the first few weeks of part-time veganning (porridge with soymilk, lentil curries for lunches, and vege sausages for dinner), I went ahead and dove in about 6 weeks ago. I've managed to branch out to more exciting meals, and I don't seem to have any problems with cravings - after all I can eat my old favourites on the weekend.


# [Falafel-]wrapping up

In the future I'll share some details about my approach, my doubts and reservations, and how I think more people could benefit from this approach.

For now, part-time veganning is the solution for me. I've got some recipes, a few tools, and I'm about 6 weeks in. I'm hoping my bad-cholesterol levels will go down quickly, but there's no guarantees - I'll post some results after my next blood test. It make for an interestng study.
